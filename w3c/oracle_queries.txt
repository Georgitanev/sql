(Only work in Oracle 3, )



1. Find second highest salary of employee from emp table

select max(sal) from emp
where sal not in(select max(sal) from emp)

OR
select max(sal) from emp
where sal <(select max(sal) from emp)

2. Department - high salary by department 

select max(sal), deptno 
from emp
group by deptno
;

(how many employees in each department?)
select count(*), deptno
from emp
group by deptno;

3. Display alternate reccords

(rownum)
select rownum, empno, sal, ename from emp;

(order by salary desc)
select rownum, empno, sal, ename from emp
order by sal desc;

(get rows who are with odd numbers !=/2 (1,3,5,...) 
select * from 
    (select rownum rn, empno, ename, sal
        from emp
        order by rn)
        where mod (rn, 2) != 0;

(same with even numbers)
select * from 
    (select rownum rn, empno, ename, sal
        from emp
        order by rn)
        where mod (rn, 2) = 0;

4. Display duplicate of a column
(in table there is no duplicated names of employees)
(so you can search by job column where there is duplicates)


(displays name, (number of repeating names of employees))

(ename)
select ename, count(*)
from emp
group by ename;

(job)
select ename, count(*)
from emp
group by ename;

(duplicate values - name, count of repeats)

(ename)
select ename, count(*)
from emp
group by ename
having count(*)>1;

(job)
select job, count(*)
from emp
group by job
having count(*)>1;

5. Pattern matching in SQL

(select names who start with 'M'

select ename from emp
where ename like 'M%';

(select names who Ends with 'N')
select ename from emp
where ename like '%N';

(select names who have letter 'M' in the name)

select ename from emp
where ename like '%M%';

(not contain 'M' in name)

select ename from emp
where ename not like '%M%';

6. Pattern searching in SQL

6.1
(Display names of all employees whose name contains
exacly 4 letters)

select ename from emp
where ename like '____';

6.2
(Display names of all employees whose name contains
the (i)second letter and 'L'(ii) fourth letter as 'M'

select ename from emp
where ename like '_L%';

select ename from emp
where ename like '___M%';

6.3
(Display the emloyee names and hire dates for 
the employees joined in the month of December)
select hiredate, ename from emp
where hiredate like '%DEC%';

6.4
(Display the names of employees whose name contains exactly 2 'L' s)

select ename from emp
where ename like '%LL%'

6.5
(Display the name of employees whose name starts with 

select ename from emp
where ename like 'J%S'
